    "## Step 1: Training Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step of the notebook, you will customize the training of your CNN-RNN model by specifying hyperparameters and setting other options that are important to the training procedure.  The values you set now will be used when training your model in **Step 2** below.\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference. I started off with 3 epochs however from viewing the loss rate change 1 seemed enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN encoder is mostly unchanged from how it was provided. I added a BatchNorm1d layer to this. \n",
    "\n",
    "My decoder is based on ideas from the paper \"Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator\" and from the video content in the Udacity course material. \n",
    "\n",
    "The captions are put through an embed layer this is then merge with the image data to produce a sequence. A LSTM layer is then used followed by a linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch size was set to 32 initially based on the suggestion of course content as an optimal average. I then increased this to 64 which seemed to make perplexity drop quicker during training. I also selected hidden_size and embed_size of 512 based on the table provided in Udacity course material and as outlined in \"Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The defaults provided seemed correct to me so I did not change. I left these the same as they appears to already correctly size and normalize the image. There was a level of chance in terms of cropping and flipping which seemed good to increase the images the the network was training on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The suggestions of using all parameters from the decoder and just the embedded parameters from the encoder seemed like a sensible place to start. Since the decoder is untrained it made sense to provide all parameters. Since this the embed layer is added after the pretrained CNN including this in the parameters to train seemed wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Adam as it is based on Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm. Since this is adaptive it seemed like one of the best choices for this problem. I started with a learning rate of 0.01 as this suggested starting point in the Hyperparameters Udacity course material and updated to 0.001 which improved training."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
